* `Requisite that the analysis task yields what the user's current emotional state`

Previous work on this feature can be found [here](https://github.com/cartheur-voice/voice-emotion-detector). The training data is [here](https://github.com/cartheur-voice/voice-emotion-detector/tree/main/datasets).

#### Training data

Included in the `datasets` folder and is included in the build. The idea is that this program could output trained responses, rather than trainspotting all the time!

#### Accord Tools

The old [website](http://accord-framework.net).
