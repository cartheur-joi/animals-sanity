Animals sanity code set

22.01.2026
    1155: Start here.
    1158: Task-set on ReadMe.
    1230: Sending to Visual Studio for cleaning.
    1259: Cleaned and sorted, what about CsCore stuff?
    1435: CsCore now animals-audio, with tests of unknown quality.
    1445: Code is mechanically correct, have to add a 500MB set of training audio; this project could process this for other projects.
    1550: An error with a label in the training data. Took the time to secure the sources for Accord.* as Tools in a repo.
